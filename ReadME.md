# Working with Octis

## Motivation

This repository has been esntablished for two reasons: (1) to demonstarate the possible use cases for the [Octis](https://github.com/MIND-Lab/OCTIS/) package and (2) to highlight some areas of improvement for the package.

## Background

Topic modeling is a powerful technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that helps to identify the underlying themes or topics in a collection of text documents. It is especially useful when working with large datasets, as it enables researchers to quickly gain insights into the main topics covered in the corpus without having to manually read through each document. Topic modeling uses statistical algorithms to cluster together words that frequently co-occur in the same document, and then identifies the most important topics or themes based on these word clusters. This allows researchers to explore patterns and trends within the data, uncover hidden insights, and make informed decisions based on their findings. With the rapid growth of digital content, topic modeling has become an increasingly important tool for businesses, academics, and researchers looking to extract value from large collections of text data.

[MindLab](https://github.com/MIND-Lab/OCTIS), a research group at the [University of Milan](https://www.unimib.it/) (Unimlb), published a [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2021.eacl-demos.31.pdf) in 2021, where they introduced a platform to optimize the tuning process for topic modeling.
